\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
In the paper described a new hardware design metodology, in which pragmatics of design goal has the most significant influence on design ever. The author showed  basics of pragmatics dependent approach and proposes solution for automated transition from semantic notation of solution of problem given to specific syntaxes, described its implementation.
