\section{Conclusion}
The described approach has a long history, but means to implement it and need in it emerged only nowadays. The state of microelectronic industry requires reconfigurable logic as one of the possible ways to avoid crysis which may come with the end of the Moore's low. A software proposed in the paper to compile sematic representation of problem's solution to syntax representation plays an important role in the approach, as one of the parts of it, which could be fully automated. That is why during the research a concept of the adaptive development environment was developed at first time. The software is a proof of concept rather the one which ready for use in the industry, but it demonstrates ability to remove margin between software and hardware compiling the same semantic description of problem's solution into x86 assembly snd Verilog code. It is expected that the approach will produce more reliable hardware and software, and will increase portability.
